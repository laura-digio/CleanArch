> The most important aspects of the internal design of a software system.

A good architecture is important, otherwise it becomes slower and more expensive to add new capabilities in the future.

# Design patterns

[**Design patterns**](/doc/design_patterns.md) are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They're templates designed to help you write code that's easy to understand and reuse.

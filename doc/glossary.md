## Cloud computing

**Cloud computing** is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers.

## SaaS

> Software-as-a-Service

**SaaS** is a cloud computing service model in which the cloud provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the internet. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, alongside Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).

## Serverless computing

**Serverless computing** is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity. It can be a form of utility computing.

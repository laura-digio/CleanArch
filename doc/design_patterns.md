Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design.

They help you create loosely coupled code so that you can change or replace components in your code easily and with confidence.

## Singleton

**Singleton** is a **creational design pattern** that ensures that only one instance exists for a given class and that there’s a global access point to that instance.

It usually uses lazy loading to create the single instance when it’s needed the first time.

## Observer

**Observer** is a **behavioral design pattern** where one object notifies other objects of any state changes.

## Repository

**Repository** is an **structural design pattern** that provides an abstraction of data, so that your application can work with a simple abstraction that has an interface. Using this pattern keeps domain objects persistence ignorant.

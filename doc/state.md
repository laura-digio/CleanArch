# State management

State is all the stored information, at a given instant in time, to which the program has access. A program is described as stateful if it is designed to remember preceding events or user interactions; the remembered information is called the state of the system.

So, we can say that the state is the sum of all variables in our app's memory.

A **state machine** is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The state machine can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs. The change from one state to another is called a **transition**. An state machine is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.

So, we can say that an app is a state machine!

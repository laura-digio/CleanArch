# Physical Tier VS Logical Layer

- A **Physical Tier** refers to the physical separation of responsibilities in a system across different servers, machines, or processors. Each tier might have its own CPU, memory, and storage, and they communicate with each other over a network. This is often done for reasons of scaling or resilience.

- A **Logical Layer** refers to the logical separation of responsibilities within the software architecture itself. This could be within a single program, and these layers do not necessarily have to be on different physical machines. Examples of logical layers include the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer.

It's important to note that a single physical tier can run multiple logical layers, and a single logical layer can be spread across multiple physical tiers. The two concepts are independent of each other.
